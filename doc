Hi Suraj,
Have added below 8 good resources around the stock app topic. Lot of them are at different stages of completion. (Option 8 seemed better)

1.
keeps track of what's discussed on Reddit. Feel free to take a look: https://stocksentiment.io

2.
check out www.hype-rider.com

3.
https://sentimentinvestor.com/ - these guys published an article about how the site works. For the time being they “only” track Reddit and Twitter

4.
SwaggyStocks.com
does a great job at monitoring online sentiment, completely free

5.
https://shirosaidev.github.io/stocksight/?

6.
script to scrape reddit stocks, and then decided to put it up on a site - memebergterminal.com, so everyone can access the data.

7.
Marketsentiment.live

8.
GamestonkTerminal

You can find the repo available here: https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal.


https://github.com/iam-abbas/Reddit-Stock-Trends

But in summary, the Terminal has 7 distinct menus:

* Discover Stocks
   * Some features are: Top gainers; Sectors performance; upcoming earnings releases; top high shorted interest stocks; top stocks with low float; top orders on fidelity; and some SPAC websites with news/calendars.
* Market Sentiment
   * Main features are: Scrolling through Reddit main posts, and most tickers mentions; Extracting trending symbols on stocktwits, or even stocktwit sentiment based on bull/bear flags; Twitter in-depth sentiment prediction using AI; Google mentions over time.
* Research Web pages
   * List of good pages to do research on a stock, e.g. macroaxis, zacks, macrotrends, ..
* Fundamental Analysis 

   * Read financials from a company from Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Financial Modeling Prep API. Since I only rely on free data, I added the information from all of these, so that the user can get it from the source it trusts the most. Also exports management team behind stock, along with their pages on Google, to speed up research process.
* Technical Analysis
   * The usual technical indicators: sma, rsi, macd, adx, bbands, and more.
* Due Diligence
   * It has several features that I found to be really useful. Some of them are: Latest news of the company; Analyst prices and ratings; Price target from several analysts plot over time vs stock price; Insider activity, and these timestamps marked on the stock price historical data; Latest SEC fillings; Short interest over time; A check for financial warnings based on Sean Seah book.
* Prediction Techniques
   * The one I had more fun with. It tries to predict the stock price, from simple models like sma and arima to complex neural network models, like LSTM. The additional capability here is that all of these are easy to configure. Either through command line arguments, or even in form of a configuration file to define your NN.
